											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My name is Idris Anwar, I'm an Australian Indonesian, and I'm a gamer who likes to screw around with computers and other tech stuff out of curiosity, and also likes to learn Japanese, biased for Persona 3 and Halo: Reach my favourite games and talk about how great of a game from 10+ years ago they are, and listen to the same video game soundtrack or Japanese music for 3 months till I fall off it and scramble through my list of music.</p>

										<h3>Interest in Information Technology</h3>
										<p>My interest in IT slowly developed when I was 7 years old, I was preoccupied with cable management at the back of the living room TV, drawing boxes on Microsoft Paint that resembles a TV set and spend most of my time playing computer games. 
											It was when I was 10 years old, my older brother built his first gaming personal computer which sparked my interest in information technology relating to computer peripherals, which led to me spending countless of hours watching computer build guides.
											At the time, I had to use my weak laptop to play Minecraft and Team Fortress 2 because my older brother never allowed me to use his personal computer.</p>
									</li>

										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Education</h3>
										<p>During high school, I spent 2 years studying Information Software Technology and 1 year on Information Technology. Later, I decided to drop Information Technology subject to lighten my workload for HSC preparation. It was also because I did not have much interest in coding to begin with. I only showed much interest in videos of people coding that would be beneficial to society or industries.</p>

									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
									<p>The project idea I have come up with is a speedrunning tool that can automatically split the timer after completion of a segment in a video game, which allows the game user playing the game to have full concentration on the game without having to manually press a button to split the timer every time the game user completes a segment.</p>
									<p>This idea is not big or interesting but a useful tool for game users who enjoy or take speedrunning video games professionally in which they require full concentration on the game. Having another game user to split or stop the timer for the game can result in inaccurate timing corresponding to the run of the category being a few milliseconds off what the final results should have ended with, as the person’s reaction time to the timing of the run can be a split-second delay which can impact the final record thus the game user’s ability to beat the other game user’s record.</p>
									<p>The app will automatically split the timer upon detecting a frame from a video capture software that corresponds to the image sampled, which signifies that the segment of the game is complete. This can vary on a lot of games as to how the segment or level is completed, but for this project I will be using Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for the Nintendo Switch for the app to automatically split in which it needs to split the time upon seeing the “finish” sign on screen as soon as I finish a race. Because the app is AI based it needs to learn to detect the same message or frame on screen in game that would signify that the segment is complete multiple times before understanding the pattern. The app will have its own timer and profiles for specific games and categories that corresponds to the number of segments required to complete a speedrun. The app will automatically update the categories for world record runs to compare next to the user’s run.</p>
									<p>The app will be programmed in C++ as well as the AI functionality. The software used for programming will be Notepad++. For displaying the video output of the game I will be using OBS. The hardware used for this project will be my laptop of course, a Nintendo Switch and an Elgato HD60S capture card to display the game’s video output to OBS.</p>
